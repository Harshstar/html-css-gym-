    <p>When you're working hard to get fit and lose weight, you want a routine that offers maximum results. And you don't even need to become a gym rat; studies show that shorter bouts of exercise are more effective for fat loss. But what kind of exercise burns the most calories? Cardio, of course, will torch cals. Running on a treadmill will burn 25-39% more calories than doing kettlebell swings at the same level of exertion, according to a 2012 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research. But your best bet for weight loss is a routine that combines cardio and strength.</p>
    <p>
        Yes, if you're walking or running like mad without results, building muscle may be the key that unlocks the scale.   Why? Muscles are metabolically active, so they burn calories even when you're not exercising. To fit cardio and strength into your workout, consider interval training.

        <h1>1) Running (burn:566–839 calories/hour)-(10-minute mile pace)</h1>

        <p>
            Whether you love or hate it, running is one of the best and simplest ways to burn calories—and you don't need a treadmill to do it. Just lace up your shoes and hit the road. Running in intervals—speeding up and slowing down your pace—will help make the minutes and miles go by quickly. Run in fartleks, which means speedplay in Swedish, where you pick up the pace every other street lamp or water hydrant you hit, and then slow down after you pass the next one.

            "Jumping rope is a great way to burn calories while  improving cardiovascular health, all-over-toning, and coordination, and it will help build power while lowering your risk of injury," If the last time you held a jump rope was in grade school, it’s time to get back into the swing of things. This calorie-busting workout can burn up to 318 calories (for a 140-pound woman) every 30 minutes—and your heart isn’t the only muscle that's working hard, Jumping rope is a full-body workout. Fire up your quads and glutes to help you explode from the ground, and engage your core to keep you upright and stable as you land back down. Jumping rope also involves a little arm and shoulder action, as they remain tight while the rope movement comes from the wrists.

        <p>
            Kickboxing is a great way to burn calories, sculpt muscles, and get some serious stress relief! By driving power from your legs, your arms are able to throw major jabs, crosses, hooks and uppercuts, making it a full-body exercise. It will also test your coordination and endurance—all essential things that make you a better athlete in and out of the ring.

        <h1>4) High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h1>
        <img src="hiit.jpg" alt="" height="250">
        <p>
            High-intensity interval training (also called HIIT) is a type of workout that switches back and forth from intense physical activity to less-intense exercise. You shouldn't do it every day, but it's very effective for weight loss because HIIT makes your body use energy from fat instead of carbs. You’ll also burn more calories with HIIT than with steady cardio. The intense exercise keeps your body working and in fat-burning mode for up to 24 hours after your workout ends.
